                    When I was in my second year of college, I took a student-led class on campus called "Web Design DeCal."  After learning how to create some basic websites in that class, I became interested in design. I soon learned about the field of UI/UX, and how people actually make it into a career.  So, once the academic year ended, I decided to enroll in a summer class in order for me to learn the intricacies and increase my knowledge of UI/UX. I found a User Interface Design Specialization that was offered on Coursera in the Summer of 2018.  This is my final project for that class.

                <p class="cs-section-description-full">
                    There are a wide variety of situations where someone would want to collect their personal information.  Maybe an individual wants to track their eating habits. Maybe an individual wants to want to monitor how many times they have visited a certain restaurant.  Maybe an individual wants to know how much they spent in the past month. Maybe an individual needs to track their blood sugar so they know the right amount of insulin to administer.  Whatever the reason, there are many reasons for an individual to gather their own personal metrics. For our capstone project for the class, my team and I were given the very general topic of:
                    <br><br> "personal informatics app"
                    <br><br> We were told to narrow the topic down into a specific purpose.  We could involve a large variety of personal information recording functions.  The design is also open ended, meaning that we could make the product basically anything we want.  We only had to make sure the product provided a way for the user to specify a set of information they want to keep track of, provided a way to enter data, and provided a way to visualize the data.  So, keeping these guidelines in mind, we moved on to conduct user research.
