                <div class="cs-row">
                    <p> Perceived performance is a vague, little explored concept that is influenced by a variety of factors
                        including task completion steps, task completion time, and loading treatments, to name a few. Perceived
                        performance is a mix of a user’s expectations, usability, and technical performance speed and potentially
                        a lot of other (subjective) factors. A well designed platform can get high user satisfaction despite
                        delays in the processes, while poorly designed solutions can be perceived as slow despite fast technical
                        speed. The speed at which a task can process is often time limited by physical hardware limitations,
                        especially if tasks require to process or transfer large amounts of data, which is often the case with
                        Salesforce. The science and art of perceived performance is to exploit users inability to accurately
                        judge real performance, or objective clock time, and optimize psychological (or brain time) which is the
                        subjective user’s perception of the passage of time. </p>
                    <p> Based on our research and information of the most popular CRM Salesforce, many users spend a large amount
                        of their work day (4-8 hours on average) using it. Given that Salesforce is the central platform for many
                        of its users and their interactions with the product makes up the majority of their tasks, a high
                        importance is placed on how satisfied users are with it. As indicated before, satisfaction is highly
                        impacted by performance metrics such as loading time, but also highly depends on how a user thinks the
                        system performs. As a result, perceived performance has a strong influence on the user's satisfaction,
                        and, therefore, eventually also on retention and business-relevant metrics such as customer lifetime
                        value. The goal of this project–to improve the overall experience for users, and determine opportunities
                        for improvement of perception of performance of Salesforce software–has a relevant business impact. </p>

                <div class="cs-row">
                    <p> Salesforce’s main goals of this project was to get a better understanding of the perception of performance
                        of their product by the user. We specified the following three research goals to guide our research approach: </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li> Identification of factors influencing perceived performance </li>
                        <li> Diagnosis of usability issues and opportunities related to identified factors </li>
                        <li> Assessment of different types of loading treatments </li>
                    </ol>

                <div class="cs-row"><h2>3. Research Methods</h2></div>
                <div class="cs-row">
                    <p> Our research approach consisted of the following research methods. Each step of the research design informed
                        the next one to some degree. </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li> Interviews on perceived performance - with users and non-users to learn how to assess performance </li>
                        <li> Observation of Salesforce users - of users of the platform to understand the user flow </li>
                        <li> Cognitive walkthrough - and task analysis of the platform to identify usability opportunities </li>
                        <li> Usability testing of mockups - of mockups to test different types of loading treatment </li>
                    </ol>
