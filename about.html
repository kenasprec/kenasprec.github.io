                <h2> Hi!  My name is Kendal. </h2>
                <p> I am currently a fourth year undergraduate studying Cognitive Science at the <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu/">
                    University of California, Berkeley. </a> With the knowledge I learn from my studies, I hope to create beautiful
                    products that serve the wants and needs of the people using the human-centered design approach.</p>
                <p> Originally, when I first enrolled to UC Berkeley, I was following the Computer Science route, hoping to become a
                    software engineer in the future. As time progressed, I found myself leaning more towards the more creative side
                    of the field while avoiding the actual programming. Eventually, at the summer of 2018, I decided to take a set of
                    online Coursera classes labeled <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/user-interface-design">
                    User Interface Design Specialization</a>. I instantly fell in love. </p>
                <p> When I'm not spending time interacting with different prototypes, I spend time interacting with people. Find me
                    playing different kinds of sports, sampling the local delicacies, or simply taking a seat and starting a
                    pleasant conversation. </p>
                <p> Please feel free to connect with me through my email <a href="mailto: kenasprec@berkeley.edu">
                    kenasprec@berkeley.edu </a> or through <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kendalasprec/"> LinkedIn</a>!  </p>
