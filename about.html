                <h2> Hi!  My name is Kendal. </h2>
                <p> I am a UX Researcher who always prioritizes the needs of the user. </p>
                <p> As a recent graduate of the <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu/"> University of California,
                    Berkeley </a> with a B.A. in Cognitive Science, I have spent the past four years studying the human
                    mind and its processes. Through the many interdisciplinary studies that form Cognitive Science, I
                    learned a great deal about technology, people, and how people experience technology. I am fascinated
                    by the wide range of experiences that different users have with the same interface, and I love
                    finding the changes that could be made in order to improve the user's experience overall.
                </p>
                <p> When I'm not spending time learning about a user's problems and discovering usability issues, I enjoy
                    spending my time interacting with people. Find me attending a wide variety of events, playing
                    different kinds of games, or simply taking a seat and starting a pleasant conversation. </p>
                <p> Please feel free to connect with me through my email <a href="mailto: kenasprec@berkeley.edu">
                    kenasprec@berkeley.edu </a> or through <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kendalasprec/"> LinkedIn</a>!  </p>
